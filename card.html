        Around 10,500 years ago, cattle were domesticated from as few
        as 80 progenitors in southeast Turkey. According to an
        estimate from 2011, there are 1.4 billion cattle in the world.
        In 2009, cattle became one of the first livestock animals to
        have a fully mapped genome. Some consider cattle the oldest
        form of wealth, and cattle raiding consequently one of the
        earliest forms of theft.
